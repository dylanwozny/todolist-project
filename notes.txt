----Developer tools (dev-dependencies)---- 
These tools are for development, they do not run in the browser in finished app

Sass
Parcel

"npm install -D parcel sass http-server"



----Modules for code (dependencies)-----
Code/app actually uses these modules.

lodash
uuid

"npm install uuid lodash"

---Scripts---
short cut to run commands
You can put any commands here you want to run on the terminal

clean: cleans out dev files if your getting errors. Clearing cache can sometimes fix it


  "scripts": {
    "test": "none",
    "start": "npx parcel src/index.html",
    "build": "npx parcel build src/index.html" <----- "npm run build",
    "clean:dev": "rm -rf .parcel-cache dist",
    "clean:git": "rm -rf .parcel-cache dist node_modules"
  },

 

-----Sass-----
  Once you run parcel with a Sass file it will
  download a Sass compiler

  compile file
  "cntrl + shift + p"

  Jim is working on a fix for this, cant watch sass right now..
